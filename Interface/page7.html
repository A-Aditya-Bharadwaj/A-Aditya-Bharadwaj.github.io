            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                A man, dressed in a dark blue shirt, was on foot, transporting his gray scooter that appeared to be inoperable, all the while repeatedly requesting a lift by extending his arm. Another man in a light blue shirt was riding his bike when he noticed the distressed man signaling for a lift. He stopped by the man's side. The man in the navy blue shirt explained that his scooter was damaged, and he had been waiting for a long time, unable to find any public transport. He asked if the passerby could give him a lift.<br><br>

                The other man hesitated, explaining that he was already running late. However, the man in the navy blue shirt insisted, mentioning that his phone was also not working, and he didn't think he would find a mechanic nearby.<br><br>
                
                The other man finally relented and asked how far he needed a lift. The response was, "Just till the nearby Veer Savarkar Block."<br><br>
                
                
                The man in the navy blue shirt introduced himself as Shanky and mentioned that he worked for an IT company. He then asked for the other man's name. The man replied, "I'm Kunal Rewa”  and he is a videographer on his way to shoot at a wedding."<br><br>
                
                Shanky expressed his gratitude, saying that if Kunal hadn't stopped, he might have had to spend the night at the bus stand. Kunal humbly replied that if he hadn't helped, someone else probably would have. Shanky responded, "Yes, but I might not have connected with someone as kind as you."<br><br>
                
                Kunal asked when Shanky planned to retrieve his scooter. Shanky replied that he would go back for it after some time, adding, "Theft happens even in broad daylight. What's the guarantee of safety at night?"<br><br>
                
                Kunal nodded and said, "You're absolutely right. Delhi can be quite unpredictable at times, not just in terms of theft but also with murders." He then extended an invitation, "How about we grab a cup of tea? I know a place where they serve my favorite tea."<br><br>
                
                
                 Kunal requested Ravi, the man at the tea stall, to prepare two cups of tea. As they savored their tea, they both shared their appreciation for its flavor. Curious about each other's lives, Shanky inquired about Kunal’s  household.<br><br>
                
                Kunal revealed, "I live with my wife," and returned the question, "And what about you, Shanky?"<br><br>
                
                Shanky responded, "I'm married as well, but I don't live with my wife."<br><br>
                
                Intrigued, Kunal asked, "Oh, why is that?"<br><br>
                
                Shanky sighed and disclosed, "Well, my wife had an affair with someone else." Kunal expressed his empathy and offered an apology.<br><br>
                
                Shanky, with a resigned smile, replied, "It's okay, Kunal. That's life; it's okay. Sometimes you're with someone, and sometimes you're alone."<br><br>
                
                
                Kunal insisted on paying the tea bill on behalf of Shanky and then asked, "Do you think we'll meet again sometime?"<br><br>
                
                As they continued on their journey, Shanky asked Kunal, "How long has it been since your marriage?"<br><br>
                
                Kunal replied, "It's only been two years, but it feels like a lifetime has passed. But still there's something peaceful about coming home and having your wife open the gate for you."<br><br>
                
                Curious, Kunal asked, "What about you, Shanky? Why aren't you considering another marriage?"<br><br>
                
                Shanky replied, "I'm content being on my own."<br><br>
                
                Kunal responded, "But, Shanky, you can't spend your entire life alone." <br>
                Shanky agrees but he says that he life is passing and its okay<br><br>
                
                They reach near Shanky’s apartment. Shanky insisted kunal to come to his house , politely  denying kunal said that he will be late for the wedding but shanky was insisting that he was grateful to him and that kunal should join him for a drink.<br>
                He says that everyday he drinks allow and today he might get a partner and kunal agreed and said okay just for 2 pegs.<br><br>
                
                They both entered Shanky's apartment, and Shanky poured liquor into two glasses. However, Kunal started acting strangely and asked, "Aren't you afraid to take a lift from a stranger, then invite him into your home and share a drink?"<br><br>
                
                Shanky calmly responded, "There's no reason to be afraid, Kunal. I believe you're a good person."<br><br>
                
                Kunal suddenly burst into laughter and said, "You know, there's a serial killer roaming around Delhi. He's already committed five murders."<br><br>
                
                Shanky, with a concerned look, asked, "Are you joking?"<br><br>
                
                Kunal replied, his tone serious, "I'm not joking, Shanky. Do you even know who I am  and what I do? Nobody saw me coming, and nobody will know when I leave. If I chooses to, you could be my sixth victim and started attacking shanky But later, Kunal couldn't hold back his laughter any longer and confessed, "Haha, Shanky, it was just a prank! In my luggage, there's nothing but camera equipment, no weapons or anything like that."<br><br>
                
                Sometime later, Shanky began to behave strangely, questioning Kunal about the earlier conversation regarding the murderer. He asked, "Did you really check your phone when I told you it wasn't working?" Then, to Kunal's surprise, Shanky showed that his phone was, in fact, working.<br><br>
                
                Shanky continued to explain, "You didn't even check if my scooter was working, you know."<br><br>
                
                He went on, "And you see, Kunal, no one saw you coming, and no one would know if something happened to you. You don't even know who I am or what I actually do." To Kunal's shock, Shanky pulled out a knife and started acting erratically, even attempting to choke Kunal. In the midst of this, Shanky revealed that since his wife left him, he despised every happily married man.<br><br>
                
                Terrified, Kunal cried out, pleading with Shanky to let him go. Then, to Kunal's immense relief, Shanky burst into laughter and revealed, "I was just joking!"<br><br>
                
                Later, Kunal's breathing became increasingly labored, and he began to cough uncontrollably. His coughing showed no signs of stopping, and in that distressing moment, Shanky revealed that he had indeed meant what he had said earlier about preferring to drink alone.<br><br>
                
                As Kunal's coughing fit escalated, he desperately asked Shanky what he had mixed in his liquor. Weakened and overwhelmed, Kunal eventually collapsed, gasping for air.<br><br>
                
                In a chilling turn of events, Shanky calmly prepared another drink and placed it beside the fallen Kunal.<br><br>
