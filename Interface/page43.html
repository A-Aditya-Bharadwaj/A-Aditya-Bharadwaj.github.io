            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                A taxi driver got a call from his boss and his boss told that you haven&#39;t fulfilled today&#39;s target so you
                have to do extra work on the night shift and then the taxi driver ask about Raju and then his boss
                said that Raju got caught in a rape case and so you should be careful about that and he is in jail now.
                After some time the taxi driver got a passenger that was a girl and she said that she had to go to the
                airport and it was too late so can you drop me there then that taxi driver told her that it was too late
                and that the airport is too far so I can&#39;t go there and then after negotiation the taxi driver agreed to
                drop her at the airport and then she put her luggage in the trunk of the car and then sit inside the
                car and they started heading towards the airport. During the journey the girls initiated the
                conversation and said thanks to the taxi driver that he agreed to drop her at the airport otherwise
                she will miss her flight and then she asked that you work in the night shift then the taxi driver told no
                to fulfil my target I have to do night shift and then the girl asked that you didn&#39;t sleep at night and
                then the driver replied strangely and in a poetic manner that there used to be time when I used to
                sleep the whole time and then the girl said that you are poetic too and then the taxi driver said that I
                didn&#39;t pass class 10th exam but I have passion for study and then I came here to earn money and
                then the girl said that you seems to be in pain so you can share your pain with me I&#39;m with you for
                next sometimes as our destination is too far so we can talk and you can share your pain with me and
                then he started sharing all the things that he suffered from and then he said that there used to be a
                tree in my village and I used to sit under the tree and it heals my pain and then someone cut the tree
                and I cant get anywhere else to relieve my pains then the girl said that the country should develop so
                someone might cut the tree to make highway there and then the girl asked that do not you feel
                scared at night while driving and then the taxi driver said yes I do fear that something might wrong
                will go with me Or I will end up doing something wrong with others then the girls asked that are you
                married and then the taxi driver replied yes and then the girl said that are you living with your wife
                and the taxi driver replied no see lives in the village and I don&#39;t have any child and then girl said that
                didn&#39;t you feel lonely in this big city and the girl said that do you love her and then the he replied
                that yeah I do and the girl asked the taxi driver that you have any affair and then the taxi driver said
                no and then she also asked about that had your wife had any affair and then the taxi driver got angry
                and said that what are you talking about and then the girl said that you are living in this city and she
                is in village so she might have any affair and then the taxi driver said that if it will happen then I will
                kill her And then the girl lip replied that you thought that like I am mad but in this city everyone is
                mad and everyone is doing crime and if the crime came out then everyone everyone will be in jail
                and and the girls were talking strangely like do you fear with me and her expression was weird Then
                taxi driver replied that how can I be scared of a woman and then that girl pointed gun on that taxi
                driver and then said him to stop the car on the side of the road and then the taxi driver stopped the
                car taxi on the side of the road And when the taxi driver stopped the car on the road on the side of

                with this girl and then the girl said that it will be useful to you as it is this city is full of crime and you
                will need at anytime so you have to keep it at any cost And said that the world is cruel so you have to
                kill someone or like you otherwise someone will kill you and then she stepped out of the taxi And
                after sometime a policeman came and told him that why are you standing the car on the side of the
                road and then the driver got feared and said that I haven&#39;t done anything then the policeman said
                that step out of the car I need to check your taxi And when the taxi driver stay out of the car then
