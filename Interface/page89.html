            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                A man wearing pink shirt and blood stain on his shirt was walking abnormly like he had pain in  his knees to his house. A girl named mansi who was his sister in law opens the door and her laughter  dropped on seeing the man and she walks back to sit on the sofa where her boyfriend was present.<br>
                On seeing her reaction the man asked why did she react like that and mansi asked what reaction is he talking about . The man continued that I was dead and someone had tried to kill him and where is the police and hadn’t they called the police yet and why is everything normal.
                Mansi asks if he is drunk in the morning and her boyfriend agrees with her and says that the man indeed looked drunk.<br><br>
                
                The man was irritated with the presence of his sister in law's boyfriend and asked if he was there all night to which the girl said that he is her boyfriend and she can call him whenever she likes.<br><br>
                
                The man reminded her that it is not her house and doesn't care what the man has gone through. She asks the man to not start any drama. <br><br>
                
                He tells her that this is no drama and he was dead actually. <br><br>
                
                She asks why would she believe him as he is standing in from of him in one piece. <br><br>
                
                He asks if she doesn’t see, the blood stain and the wound on his forehead. <br><br>
                
                The girls laughs off this issue by calling him a drama queen.<br><br>
                
                He asks her to look at the condition of his clothes and She tells him that his clothes are good but has bad sense of fashion. And as far as the wound is considered she suggested her to take a painkiller. She was rude to him and didn’t care about his condition.<br><br>
                
                The man checks himself at the mirror to assure that the wound on his forehead and condition of his clothes and runs to mansi to tell her only to find her paying no heed to him.<br><br>
                
                He tells her that someone had put him in a plastic bag and threw him in the pond. <br><br>
                
                She doesnt believe him and tells him that he is doing to seek attention. He mentions that he doesn;t need to seek her attention and who does she think she is. He mentions that he is an industrialist with annual turn around of 120 crore rupees. <br>
                The girl reminded him saying all this  proves that he is seeking attention and then asks him how did he die?<br>
                He tells her that he doesnt remember but faintly tries to remember and says that he remembers that he fainted and then someone checks his breath and says that he is dead and then claims that her boyfriend Neeraj was the same guy who tried to kill him. The girl laughed at his accusation saying that she knows that her brother approve of her relationship with neeraj as he is not from rich family but that doesn’t mean he should accuse him.<br><br>
                
                  He tries to decode what had happened at says that yesterday I was drinking vodka and you asked me to sign some papers claiming that it was for university and now I realise that they were not university papers but you were trying to take all my property and his wife was also drinking with him and then goes to search for his wife. <br><br>
                
                His wife was cooking in the kitchen and he thanks god that she is alive. He complaints to her that he believes that mansi is trying to kill him by poisoning his drink last night.<br><br>
                
                His wife believes that he is complaining because he doesn’t like mansi’s boyfriend neeraj. 
                He tries to convince his wife that he was injured and shows her his wounds, his wife reacts rudely and tells him to stop it and mansi will sooner or later break up with neeraj and then he can marry her off with a rich man.<br><br>
                
                
                The man asks his wife if she can’t see the blood stains on his shirt to which she said no there is no blood stain and that he is looking handsome.<br><br>
                
                
                She serves poha to him and asks him how it is, and after sometime the man collapses and then all the people in the room comes and mamta checks if he is breathing and tries to wake him and confirms his death and breaths a sigh of relief and goes to mansi and neeraj and tells them that this is how you kill someone and taunts them that they were not able to even poison a drink and that she had added poison to the poha so accurately that he is now dead.<br>
                Mamta asks neeraj to brink a big bag and that now they should wrap the body and put it in  freezer and at night they will throw them in water and to be careful this time  and to tie a large rock at the feet so that he doesn’t come back.<br><br>
                
                Mansi tells her sister that she is grateful that the guard told her that he saw her brother in law climbing out of the canal otherwise they would have been shocked to see him alive this morning and then she goes out and calls the guard.<br><br>
                
                When Mamta got closer to check on his husband if he is dead and shocked to see her husband waking up and eating poha again. All three were shocked to see him alive then he confessed that he had doubted on all of them  and also he knew who would buy the poison from that is from the guard and that guard had told him everything.<br><br>
                
                Mamta asks the guard didn’t she pay him to which the guard said that the man had paid 50000 double to what she paid and then he switched side and didn’t poison him and instead poisoned popcorn from which mansi and and her boyfriend were eating.<br><br>
                
                Mansi  and neeraj started bleeding from nose and then they both collapse.<br><br>
                
                Then the man and her wife threw the two bodies in the canal.<br><br>
