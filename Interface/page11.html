            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                A Russian man was asleep with a woman when he suddenly woke up and vomited. He was sitting on a sofa, watching TV, which initially displayed no signal. However, when he threw the remote at it, the TV started working.<br><br>

                The woman from the room came out screaming and asked if he had vomited on the floor. The man denied it, took a sip of his beer, and the woman began to complain. She sprayed what appeared to be deodorant around her and demanded money from the man. However, the man remained focused on what was being shown on TV and asked her to be quiet. The woman was angry with the man's behavior and challenged him not to shush her.<br><br>
                
                The TV was broadcasting an advertisement for Comrade Crunch snacks, and the man reminisced about his childhood, happily eating his favorite snack, Comrade Crunch, beside his mother.<br><br>
                
                However, the man's nostalgia was interrupted when the woman angrily threw a scrunched-up can at him. He stood up from the sofa and walked to the kitchen. The woman continued to demand money urgently, mentioning that her girlfriends were waiting at the mall, and she had other customers. She warned him that if he kept her waiting any longer, she would call her man to confront him.<br><br>
                
                Meanwhile, the man was searching for something in the kitchen, and from one of the cupboards, he retrieved his favorite snack, Comrade Crunch, and took it out and took milk out of his fridge and drinks it but spits on the girls face as it was bad.<br><br>
                
                The woman screamed, asking what his problem was, and he replied that he needed milk and would get her the money. The man walked into a street where a lot of crime and fights were taking place. He entered a store and took milk from the fridge, taking a sip to check its freshness. The shopkeeper yelled at him, saying he needed to pay for it.<br><br>
                
                As the man approached the counter, he noticed another man wearing glasses who pointed a gun at the shopkeeper and demanded drugs. The shopkeeper, remaining calm and focused on the radio, replied that he didn't have any drugs. The man in glasses asked, "What kind of pharmacy doesn't have drugs?" To which the shopkeeper calmly responded, "This is not a pharmacy, bro."<br><br>
                
                The man who was standing behind him with the carton of milk asked the man with gun to step aside but the man with the gun was rude.<br><br>
                
                The man with spectacles having gun ask the shopkeeper what he has that he can give , then shopkeeper says I dont know money, the man says yes then give me the cash.<br><br>
                
                The man with the carton of milk poked the man with spectacles and said that he was in a hurry and this man got agitated that he turned around pointing his gun at him asking him to shut up when the other man twisted his arm and got his gun at shot him at the knees.<br><br>
                
                Seeing this the shopkeeper was terrified and told the man that he doesn’t want any trouble and also that he doesn’t need to pay anything too.<br>
                But the man kept the cash anyway but took the gun of the other man with him.<br><br>
                
                
                When the man reaches home the same woman and a black man eating his favourite comrach crunch. He looked shocked. The black man ate his favourite snack and also threw some on the floor. The other man was shocked and angry. <br><br>
                
                This reminded him of his childhood past where some bald men had killed his parents and the bald men were eating from  comrade crunch packet and asked the kid if the snacks were his and the bald man’s companion said that we only kill what we pay for and leave the child and it was seen that the bald men threw the comrade crunch on the floor wasting it.<br><br>
                
                Coming back from his past, he looked at the black man asking for his money.<br> 
                The black man approached near the russian man cussing his mother when the russian man slapped him and then held his head with both his hands and warned him not to talk about any man’s mother and beat him by hitting his own head to his and then punched him several times till death.<br><br>
                
                The woman screamed and went out.<br><br>
                
                
                The russian went again to the store to buy comrade crunch  and outside the house the same man previously who was wearing spectacles was in police car and was screaming on this russian man because he had shot him on his knees earlier.<br><br>
                
                Inside the shop, the shopkeeper was questioned by two police about the man who had shot the man with spectacles, the shopkeeper kept on telling the police officer that it was6 foot russian white man.<br><br>
                
                The russian man again reminisced his past where after growing up he joined the gang of bald people by being one of them and avenged the death of his parents . <br><br>
                
                The shopkeeper on seeing the same russian man again in his store warned the police officer that he is the same guy attacked the man in spectacles.<br><br>
                
                The police cussed the russian man’s mother on hearing that russian man got angry and looked back hands up and in his hands were the comrade crunch cereals.<br><br>
                
                The police asked the man to put the cereal down and the russian man asked why and the police man started shooting at him because they thought he is resisting.<br><br>
                
                The russian man took the gun from his back pocket, the one had taken earlier from the man in spectacles and shot at the police officer shouting, I just wanted to eat my cereal.<br><br>
                
                
                Both parties were injured and the russian man reached out to near fridge for  milk when he gets reminiscence of his mother who was saying my little viktor and then he reached out for a milk and put it in the cereal packet and ate handful of them and then died.
